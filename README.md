DropQuote 

This is a game where you switch letters within a column to unscramble the phrase. The difficult part of this was getting the letters to render in a table the way I wanted them to. In creating this game, I learned a lot more about tables than I anticipated. I want to expand this game by using a third party API to pull quotes.

This program was created using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
